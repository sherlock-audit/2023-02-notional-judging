# `_convertPoolClaimToStrategyTokens` can return zero strategy tokens for LP tokens

## Summary

`_convertPoolClaimToStrategyTokens` can return zero strategy tokens for LP tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `_convertPoolClaimToStrategyTokens` can return zero strategy tokens for LP tokens, the returned `strategyTokenAmount` value will be zero when the numerator is less than the denominator.

```solidity

    function _convertPoolClaimToStrategyTokens(StrategyContext memory context, uint256 poolClaim)
        internal pure returns (uint256 strategyTokenAmount) {
        if (context.vaultState.totalPoolClaim == 0) {
            // Strategy tokens are in 8 decimal precision. Scale the minted amount according to pool claim precision.
            return (poolClaim * uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION)) / 
                context.poolClaimPrecision;
        }

        // Pool claim in maturity is calculated before the new pool tokens are minted, so this calculation
        // is the tokens minted that will give the account a corresponding share of the new pool balance held.
        // The precision here will be the same as strategy token supply.
        strategyTokenAmount = (poolClaim * context.vaultState.totalStrategyTokenGlobal) / context.vaultState.totalPoolClaim;
    }
```

This is made possible because the `INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION = 1e8` is much smaller than the `poolClaimPrecision = 1e18`.

The function is used in both `_mintStrategyTokens` and `Curve2TokenConvexHelper::settleVaultEmergency`.
In `_mintStrategyTokens`, the zero strategy tokens condition is accounted for but this is not done in `settleVaultEmergency`.

The effect is that `settleVaultEmergency` will attempt to execute settlement with the pool claim and zero strategy tokens.

```solidity
        uint256 redeemStrategyTokenAmount = 
            context.baseStrategy._convertPoolClaimToStrategyTokens(poolClaimToSettle);

        _executeSettlement({
            strategyContext: context.baseStrategy,
            poolContext: context.poolContext,
            maturity: maturity,
            poolClaimToSettle: poolClaimToSettle,
            redeemStrategyTokenAmount: redeemStrategyTokenAmount,
            params: params
        });
```

The function `SettlementUtils::_executeSettlement` will therefore wrongfully set the surplus as negative which is supposed to indicate the insolvency of an account.

```solidity
        // A negative surplus here means the account is insolvent
        // (either expectedUnderlyingRedeemed is negative or
        // expectedUnderlyingRedeemed is less than underlyingCashRequiredToSettle).
        // If that's the case, we should just redeem and repay as much as possible (surplus
        // check is ignored because maxUnderlyingSurplus can never be negative).
        // If underlyingCashRequiredToSettle is negative, that means we already have surplus cash
        // on the Notional side, it will just make the surplus larger and potentially
        // cause it to go over maxUnderlyingSurplus.
        int256 surplus = expectedUnderlyingRedeemed -
            underlyingCashRequiredToSettle;
```

## Impact

Breaks the intended functionality of `settleVaultEmergency`

## Recommendation

Add the zero strategy tokens check to the `Curve2TokenConvexHelper::settleVaultEmergency` function.

```solidity
        if (strategyTokensMinted == 0) {
            revert Errors.ZeroStrategyTokens();
        }
```
