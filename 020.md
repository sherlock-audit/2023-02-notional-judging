# `ICurve2TokenPool.remove_liquidity` tuple return value not handled in `Curve2TokenVaultMixin._checkReentrancyContext`

## Summary
`ICurve2TokenPool.remove_liquidity` tuple return value not handled in `Curve2TokenVaultMixin._checkReentrancyContext`

## Vulnerability Detail
As described on the curve pool documentation https://curve.readthedocs.io/exchange-pools.html, the `remove_liquidity` function should return a list of the amounts for each token, which in our case is two, that was withdrawn.

If caller does not check `remove_liquidity`'s return value, then s/he may assume that the function succeeded and proceed with other operations, potentially resulting in a loss of assets and/or a wrong contract state.

To our best knowledge, we have `Curve2TokenVaultMixin` inherits from `BaseStrategyVault`, which in turn declares function `deleverageAccount` that calls `_checkReentrancyContext`.

## Impact
loss of assets and wrong contract state

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend the project handle the `ICurve2TokenPool.remove_liquidity` tuple return value explicitly.
