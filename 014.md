# Invalid number of decimals returned from `getOraclePrice` function

## Summary

Internal contracts or external protocols that depend on the `getOraclePrice` function might break during integration as the number of decimals returned from `getOraclePrice` function is invalid.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `decimals` returns from the `TradingModule.getOraclePrice` function is misleading and might lead to issues for internal contracts or external protocols calling this function during integration.

Per the comment, the `decimals` return value is the number of decimals for the exchange rate. If the exchange rate of USDC <> DAI is 1:1, the returned exchange rate will be `1 * 10^18`. The decimals, in this case, should be `18` representing 18 decimal points.

However, the `decimals` returned by the `TradingModule.getOraclePrice` function is `1e18`. This means that there `1000000000000000000` decimal points, which is incorrect and misleading. The returned value of `1000000000000000000 ` is the precision of the rate, not the number of decimals of the rate.

## Impact

Internal contracts or external protocols that depend on the `getOraclePrice` function might break during integration as it will return invalid results.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider updating `TradingModule.getOraclePrice` function to return the number of decimals in the rate. Note that applying this change will break the existing function that relies on the `TradingModule.getOraclePrice` function. Thus, changes would also need to be made to the caller side.

```diff
/// @notice Returns the Chainlink oracle price between the baseToken and the quoteToken, the
/// Chainlink oracles. The quote currency between the oracles must match or the conversion
/// in this method does not work. Most Chainlink oracles are baseToken/USD pairs.
/// @param baseToken address of the first token in the pair, i.e. USDC in USDC/DAI
/// @param quoteToken address of the second token in the pair, i.e. DAI in USDC/DAI
/// @return answer exchange rate in rate decimals
/// @return decimals number of decimals in the rate, currently hardcoded to 1e18
function getOraclePrice(address baseToken, address quoteToken)
	public
	view
	override
	returns (int256 answer, int256 decimals)
{
..SNIP..
	answer =
		(basePrice * quoteDecimals * RATE_DECIMALS) /
		(quotePrice * baseDecimals);
-	decimals = RATE_DECIMALS;
+	decimals = 18;
}
```

Alternatively, update the comments and variable names accordingly to match the intention so that the caller or integrator is aware of the return value.

```diff
/// @notice Returns the Chainlink oracle price between the baseToken and the quoteToken, the
/// Chainlink oracles. The quote currency between the oracles must match or the conversion
/// in this method does not work. Most Chainlink oracles are baseToken/USD pairs.
/// @param baseToken address of the first token in the pair, i.e. USDC in USDC/DAI
/// @param quoteToken address of the second token in the pair, i.e. DAI in USDC/DAI
/// @return answer exchange rate in rate decimals
- /// @return decimals number of decimals in the rate, currently hardcoded to 1e18
+ /// @return precision of the rate, currently hardcoded to 1e18
function getOraclePrice(address baseToken, address quoteToken)
	public
	view
	override
-	returns (int256 answer, int256 decimals)
+	returns (int256 answer, int256 precision)
{
..SNIP..
	answer =
		(basePrice * quoteDecimals * RATE_DECIMALS) /
		(quotePrice * baseDecimals);
-	decimals = RATE_DECIMALS;
+	precision = RATE_DECIMALS;
}
