# Vault cannot be deployed properly for newer Curve pools

## Summary

New Curve pools have a different ABI than the one that the vaults attempt to use. Not differentiating between the two will lead to silent failures when vaults are deployed for new pools.

## Vulnerability Detail

During the deploy process the leveraged vault attempts to obtain the Curve pool's LP token address by calling `CURVE_POOL.lp_token()`. However, for new pools such as CRV/ETH (https://etherscan.io/address/0x8301ae4fc9c624d1d396cbdaa1ed877821d7c511#code), there is no `lp_token` member. Instead calling `lp_token()` will trigger the fallback function. For these pools, the token is obtained by calling `token()`.

## Impact

The lp token's address will be set to the 0 address and later calls to functions such as `totalSupply` will fail, causing the vault to be in a stuck state.

## Recommendation

Check the version of the target Curve pool and toggle called functions appropiately.
