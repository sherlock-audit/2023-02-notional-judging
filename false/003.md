# The slots selected for STRATEGY_VAULT_SETTINGS_SLOT and STRATEGY_VAULT_STATE_SLOT  are NOT secure enough

## Summary
The slots selected for STRATEGY_VAULT_SETTINGS_SLOT and STRATEGY_VAULT_STATE_SLOT  are too secure enough. The two constants 1000001 and 1000002, which means their preimages are known in advance, so it is much easier to create storage collision attacks based on known preimages. 


## Vulnerability Detail
Since both STRATEGY_VAULT_SETTINGS_SLOT and STRATEGY_VAULT_STATE_SLOT  are chosen at two constant locations:  1000001 and 1000002.  The slot for each item in the mapping is based on the keccak hash of the concatenation of the index key and the slot number, it is much easier to create a storage collision attack with know preimages.

See example: [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967)

The common practice to choose a slot is using sth like 

```javascript
uint256 private constant STRATEGY_VAULT_SETTINGS_SLOT = bytes32(uint256(keccak256('TRATEGY_VAULT_SETTINGS_SLOT')) - 1)).

uint256 private constant STRATEGY_VAULT_STATE_SLOT  = bytes32(uint256(keccak256('STRATEGY_VAULT_STATE_SLOT')) - 1)).

```




## Impact
The slots chosen by STRATEGY_VAULT_SETTINGS_SLOT and STRATEGY_VAULT_STATE_SLOT  are not secure enough to avoid storage collision.

## Recommendation
Choose the slots as follows: 
```javascript
uint256 private constant STRATEGY_VAULT_SETTINGS_SLOT = bytes32(uint256(keccak256('TRATEGY_VAULT_SETTINGS_SLOT')) - 1)).

uint256 private constant STRATEGY_VAULT_STATE_SLOT  = bytes32(uint256(keccak256('STRATEGY_VAULT_STATE_SLOT')) - 1)).

```
