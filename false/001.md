# Return inside a loop in _rewardTokens

## Summary
In Solidity, a return statement inside a loop can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities, particularly when dealing with state-changing functions.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a return statement is executed inside a loop, it immediately terminates the loop and returns the specified value to the calling function. If this loop is part of a state-changing function, it can lead to unintended consequences. For example, if the loop is meant to iterate over a list of elements and perform some operation on each element, terminating the loop prematurely may leave some elements unprocessed and cause data inconsistency.
## Impact
If the loop is iterating over a large number of elements, executing a return statement inside the loop can also result in high gas costs, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
