# Deposits with raw eth will fail

## Summary

The Curve Token Utils library does not process raw eth deposits into curve pools correctly. Any such deposits will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/curve/internal/pool/Curve2TokenPoolUtils.sol#L213

The `_joinPoolAndStake` function adds liquidity to the Curve pool by calling `add_liquidity{value: msgValue}(amounts, minPoolClaim);`. Curve pools, however, assume WETH deposits by default. 

For example, see: https://etherscan.io/address/0x8301ae4fc9c624d1d396cbdaa1ed877821d7c511#code
Note the function signature for `add_liquidity`: `def add_liquidity(amounts: uint256[N_COINS], min_mint_amount: uint256, use_eth: bool = False) -> uint256:`.
Specifically, `use_eth` is False unless specified. 

Also note:
```solidity
    if not use_eth:
        assert msg.value == 0  # dev: nonzero eth amount
```

If there is a value attached to a call and `use_eth` is False, then the call reverts. The `_joinPoolAndStake` function will always revert for raw eth deposits.

## Recommendation

Set `use_eth` to `true` when making a raw eth deposit.
