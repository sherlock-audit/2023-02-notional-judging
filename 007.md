# Adding asymmetric primary and secondary amount in `_joinPoolAndStake` results in fewer pool claim minted than what should be wanted

## Summary

Loss of pool claim minted when primary and secondary amount have large discrepancy.

## Vulnerability Detail

The call in `_joinPoolAndStake` forwards the primary and secondary amount without checking the ratio. Between both, less pool claim is minted than what should be wanted. Furthermore, an attacker can abuse this arbitrage the forwarded balances if the discrepancy is large enough.

For example, suppose the primary and secondary amount are passed such a way that 1 of them is way higher than other then the pool claim minted by the stableswap algorithm to the protocol will be lot less. The attacker can now arbitrage the curve pool for an additional profit.

There doesnâ€™t even need to be an attacker, just an unbalanced amount of user deposits will also lead to lower pool claim minted.

## Impact

Loss of pool claim minted.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: Curve2TokenPoolUtils.sol

    amounts[poolContext.basePool.primaryIndex] = primaryAmount;
    amounts[poolContext.basePool.secondaryIndex] = secondaryAmount;


    poolClaimMinted = ICurve2TokenPool(address(poolContext.curvePool)).add_liquidity{value: msgValue}(
            amounts, minPoolClaim
    );

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Adding deposits should probably be managed such that, it should be added in `equal` proportion to the curve pool balances.
