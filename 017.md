# Curve Vault's setting can be set to arbitrary values during initialization

## Summary

The lack of validation against the vault settings during initialization might result in inappropriate settings being configured on the new vault. This might cause the vault to operate in an unintended manner, trades to suffer more slippage than expected, or break certain functions due to overflow/underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail

During initialization, the `CurveVaultStorage.setStrategyVaultSettings` function is called to configure the vault settings. Refer to Line 53 below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/Curve2TokenConvexVault.sol#L48

```solidity
File: Curve2TokenConvexVault.sol
48:     function initialize(InitParams calldata params)
49:         external
50:         initializer
51:         onlyNotionalOwner
52:     {
53:         __INIT_VAULT(params.name, params.borrowCurrencyId);
54:         CurveVaultStorage.setStrategyVaultSettings(params.settings);
55: 
56:         if (PRIMARY_TOKEN != Deployments.ALT_ETH_ADDRESS) {
57:             IERC20(PRIMARY_TOKEN).checkApprove(address(CURVE_POOL), type(uint256).max);
58:         }
59:         if (SECONDARY_TOKEN != Deployments.ALT_ETH_ADDRESS) {
60:             IERC20(SECONDARY_TOKEN).checkApprove(address(CURVE_POOL), type(uint256).max);
61:         }
62: 
63:         CURVE_POOL_TOKEN.checkApprove(address(CONVEX_BOOSTER), type(uint256).max);
64:     }
```

However, it was observed that the `CurveVaultStorage.setStrategyVaultSettings` function does not perform any validation against the incoming setting. Thus, the value settings can be set to an arbitrary value during initialization.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/curve/internal/CurveVaultStorage.sol#L25

```solidity
File: CurveVaultStorage.sol
25:     function setStrategyVaultSettings(StrategyVaultSettings memory settings) internal {
26: 
27:         mapping(uint256 => StrategyVaultSettings) storage store = _settings();
28:         // Hardcode to the zero slot
29:         store[0] = settings;
30: 
31:         emit VaultEvents.StrategyVaultSettingsUpdated(settings);
32:     }
```

## Impact

Some vault settings need to operate within an acceptable constraint (e.g settlement cool-down must be equal to or less than 1 day), while some vault settings must not exceed their maximum limit (e.g. maxPoolShare cannot be more 100%). Failure to configure the settings within the defined constraints, whether accidentally or intentionally, will result in the vault operating in an unintended manner, trades suffering more slippage than expected, or breaking certain functions due to overflow/underflow.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing additional validations to verify that the settings are within the acceptable limit.

```diff
function setStrategyVaultSettings(StrategyVaultSettings memory settings) internal {
+   require(settings.settlementCoolDownInMinutes <= CurveConstants.MAX_SETTLEMENT_COOLDOWN_IN_MINUTES);
+   require(settings.maxPoolShare <= CurveConstants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS);
+   require(settings.settlementSlippageLimitPercent <= CurveConstants.SLIPPAGE_LIMIT_PRECISION);
+   require(settings.postMaturitySettlementSlippageLimitPercent <= CurveConstants.SLIPPAGE_LIMIT_PRECISION);
+   require(settings.emergencySettlementSlippageLimitPercent <= CurveConstants.SLIPPAGE_LIMIT_PRECISION);
+   require(settings.oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent <= CurveConstants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS);
+   require(settings.poolSlippageLimitPercent <= CurveConstants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS);

    mapping(uint256 => StrategyVaultSettings) storage store = _settings();
    // Hardcode to the zero slot
    store[0] = settings;

    emit VaultEvents.StrategyVaultSettingsUpdated(settings);
}
```
