# Risk of reward tokens being sold by malicious users under certain conditions

## Summary

Due to the lack of validation of the selling token within the Curve adaptors, there is a risk that the reward tokens or Convex deposit tokens of the vault being sold by malicious users under certain conditions (e.g. if reward tokens equal to primary/secondary tokens OR a new exploit is found in other parts of the code).

## Vulnerability Detail

For a `EXACT_IN_SINGLE` trade within the Curve adaptors, the `from` and `to` addresses of the `exchange` function are explicitly set to `trade.sellToken` and `trade.buyToken` respectively. Thus, the swap is restricted to only `trade.sellToken` and `trade.buyToken`, which points to either the primary or secondary token of the pool. This prevents other tokens that reside in the vault from being swapped out.

However, this measure was not applied to the `EXACT_IN_BATCH` trade as it ignores the `trade.sellToken` and `trade.buyToken` , and allow the caller to define arbitrary `data.route` where the first route (`_route[0]`) and last route (`_route[last_index]`) could be any token.

The vault will hold the reward tokens (CRV, CVX, LDO) when the vault administrator claims the rewards or a malicious user claims the rewards on behalf of the vault by calling Convex's [getReward](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinanceintegration/baserewardpool#claim-rewards) function.

Assume that attacker is faster than the admin calling the reinvest function. There is a possibility that an attacker executes a `EXACT_IN_BATCH` trade and specifies the `_route[0]` as one of the reward tokens residing on the vault and swaps away the reward tokens during depositing (`_tradePrimaryForSecondary`) or redemption (`_sellSecondaryBalance`). In addition, an attacker could also sell away the Convex deposit tokens if a new exploit is found.

In addition, the vault also holds Convex deposit tokens, which represent assets held by the vault.

This issue affects the in-scope `CurveV2Adapter` and `CurveAdapter` since they do not validate the `data.route` provided by the users.

68:                 address(this)
69:             );
```

#### CurveAdapter

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/trading/adapters/CurveAdapter.sol#L66

```solidity
File: CurveAdapter.sol
22:     function _exactInBatch(Trade memory trade) internal view returns (bytes memory executionCallData) {
23:         CurveBatchData memory data = abi.decode(trade.exchangeData, (CurveBatchData));
24: 
25:         return abi.encodeWithSelector(
26:             ICurveRouter.exchange.selector,
27:             trade.amount,
28:             data.route,
29:             data.indices,
30:             trade.limit
31:         );
32:     }
```

Following are some examples of where this vulnerability could potentially be exploited. Assume a vault that supports the CurveV2's ETH/stETH pool.

1) Perform the smallest possible redemption to trigger the `_sellSecondaryBalance` function. Configure the `RedeemParams` to swap the reward token (CRV, CVX, or LDO) or Convex Deposit token for the primary token (ETH). This will cause the `finalPrimaryBalance` to increase by the number of incoming primary tokens (ETH), thus inflating the number of primary tokens redeemed.
2) Perform the smallest possible deposit to trigger the `_tradePrimaryForSecondary`. Configure `DepositTradeParams` to swap the reward token (CRV, CVX, or LDO) or Convex Deposit token for the secondary tokens (stETH). This will cause the `secondaryAmount` to increase by the number of incoming secondary tokens (stETH), thus inflating the number of secondary tokens available for the deposit.

Upon further investigation, it was observed that the vault would only approve the exchange to pull the `trade.sellToken`, which points to either the primary token (ETH) or secondary token (stETH). Thus, the reward tokens (CRV, CVX, or LDO) or Convex deposit tokens cannot be sent to the exchanges. Thus, the vault will not be affected if none of the reward tokens/Convex Deposit tokens equals the primary or secondary token.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/trading/TradingUtils.sol#L118

```solidity
File: TradingUtils.sol
115:     /// @notice Approve exchange to pull from this contract
116:     /// @dev approve up to trade.amount for EXACT_IN trades and up to trade.limit
117:     /// for EXACT_OUT trades
118:     function _approve(Trade memory trade, address spender) private {
119:         uint256 allowance = _isExactIn(trade) ? trade.amount : trade.limit;
120:         address sellToken = trade.sellToken;
121:         // approve WETH instead of ETH for ETH trades if
122:         // spender != address(0) (checked by the caller)
123:         if (sellToken == Constants.ETH_ADDRESS) {
124:             sellToken = address(Deployments.WETH);
125:         }
126:         IERC20(sellToken).checkApprove(spender, allowance);
127:     }
```

However, there might be some Curve Pools or Convex's reward contracts whose reward tokens are similar to the primary or secondary tokens of the vault. If the vault supports those pools, the vault will be vulnerable. In addition, the reward tokens of a Curve pool or Convex's reward contracts are not immutable. It is possible for the governance to add a new reward token that might be the same as the primary or secondary token.

## Impact

There is a risk that the reward tokens or Convex deposit tokens of the vault are sold by malicious users under certain conditions (e.g. if reward tokens are equal to primary/secondary tokens OR a new exploit is found in other parts of the code), thus potentially draining assets from the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to implement additional checks when performing a `EXACT_IN_BATCH` trade with the `CurveV2Adapter` or `CurveAdapter` adaptor. The first item in the route must be the `trade.sellToken`, and the last item in the route must be the `trade.buyToken`. This will restrict the `trade.sellToken` to the primary or secondary token, and prevent reward and Convex Deposit tokens from being sold (Assuming primary/secondary token != reward tokens).

```solidity
route[0] == trade.sellToken
route[last index] == trade.buyToken
```

The vault holds many Convex Deposit tokens (e.g. [cvxsteCRV](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9518c9063eb0262d791f38d8d6eb0aca33c63ed0#code)). A risk analysis of the vault shows that the worst thing that could happen is that all the Convex Deposit tokens are swapped away if a new exploit is found, which would drain the entire vault. For defense-in-depth, it is recommended to check that the selling token is not a Convex Deposit token under any circumstance when using the trade adaptor.

The trade adaptors are one of the attack vectors that the attacker could potentially use to move tokens out of the vault if any exploit is found. Thus, they should be locked down or restricted where possible.

Alternatively, consider removing the `EXACT_IN_BATCH` trade function from the affected adaptors to reduce the attack surface if the security risk of this feature outweighs the benefit of the batch function.
