# Logic Error due to different representation of Native ETH (0x0 & 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE)

## Summary

Unexpected results might occur during vault initialization if either of the pool's tokens is a Native ETH due to the confusion between `Deployments.ETH_ADDRESS (address(0))` and `Deployments.ALT_ETH_ADDRESS (0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE)`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `PRIMARY_TOKEN` or `SECONDARY_TOKEN` is explicitly converted to `Deployments.ETH_ADDRESS (address(0)` during deployment.

```solidity
File: Curve2TokenPoolMixin.sol
abstract contract Curve2TokenPoolMixin is CurvePoolMixin {
..SNIP..
24:     constructor(
25:         NotionalProxy notional_,
26:         ConvexVaultDeploymentParams memory params
27:     ) CurvePoolMixin(notional_, params) {
28:         address primaryToken = _getNotionalUnderlyingToken(params.baseParams.primaryBorrowCurrencyId);
29: 
30:         PRIMARY_TOKEN = primaryToken;
31: 
32:         // Curve uses ALT_ETH_ADDRESS
33:         if (primaryToken == Deployments.ETH_ADDRESS) {
34:             primaryToken = Deployments.ALT_ETH_ADDRESS;
35:         }
36: 
37:         address token0 = CURVE_POOL.coins(0);
38:         address token1 = CURVE_POOL.coins(1);
39:         
40:         uint8 primaryIndex;
41:         address secondaryToken;
42:         if (token0 == primaryToken) {
43:             primaryIndex = 0;
44:             secondaryToken = token1;
45:         } else {
46:             primaryIndex = 1;
47:             secondaryToken = token0;
48:         }
49: 
50:         if (secondaryToken == Deployments.ALT_ETH_ADDRESS) {
51:             secondaryToken = Deployments.ETH_ADDRESS;
52:         }
53: 
54:         PRIMARY_INDEX = primaryIndex;
55:         SECONDARY_TOKEN = secondaryToken;
```

It was observed that there is a logic error within the `Curve2TokenConvexVault.initialize` function. Based on Lines 56 and 59 within the `Curve2TokenConvexVault.initialize` function, it assumes that if either the primary or secondary token is ETH, then the  `PRIMARY_TOKEN` or `SECONDARY_TOKEN` will be set to `Deployments.ALT_ETH_ADDRESS`, which point to `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`.

However, this is incorrect as the `PRIMARY_TOKEN` or `SECONDARY_TOKEN` has already been converted to `Deployments.ETH_ADDRESS (address(0))` during deployment. Refer to the constructor of `Curve2TokenPoolMixin`.

Thus, the `PRIMARY_TOKEN` or `SECONDARY_TOKEN` will never be equal to `Deployments.ALT_ETH_ADDRESS`, and the condition at Lines 56 and 59 will always evaluate to True.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/Curve2TokenConvexVault.sol#L48

```solidity
File: Curve2TokenConvexVault.sol
contract Curve2TokenConvexVault is Curve2TokenVaultMixin {
..SNIP..
48:     function initialize(InitParams calldata params)
49:         external
50:         initializer
51:         onlyNotionalOwner
52:     {
53:         __INIT_VAULT(params.name, params.borrowCurrencyId);
54:         CurveVaultStorage.setStrategyVaultSettings(params.settings);
55: 
56:         if (PRIMARY_TOKEN != Deployments.ALT_ETH_ADDRESS) {
57:             IERC20(PRIMARY_TOKEN).checkApprove(address(CURVE_POOL), type(uint256).max);
58:         }
59:         if (SECONDARY_TOKEN != Deployments.ALT_ETH_ADDRESS) {
60:             IERC20(SECONDARY_TOKEN).checkApprove(address(CURVE_POOL), type(uint256).max);
61:         }
62: 
63:         CURVE_POOL_TOKEN.checkApprove(address(CONVEX_BOOSTER), type(uint256).max);
64:     }
```

As a result, if the `PRIMARY_TOKEN` or `SECONDARY_TOKEN` is `Deployments.ETH_ADDRESS (address(0))`, the code will go ahead to call the `checkApprove` function, which might cause unexpected results during vault initialization.

## Impact

Unexpected results during vault initialization if either of the pool's tokens is a Native ETH.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the `PRIMARY_TOKEN` or `SECONDARY_TOKEN` is equal to `Deployments.ALT_ETH_ADDRESS` or `Deployments.ETH_ADDRESS`, this means that it points to native ETH and the `checkApprove` can be safely skipped.
