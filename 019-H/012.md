# Ineffective slippage mechanism when redeeming proportionally

## Summary

A trade will continue to be executed regardless of how bad the slippage is since the minimum amount returned by the `TwoTokenPoolUtils._getMinExitAmounts` function does not work effectively. Thus, a trade might incur significant slippage, resulting in the vault receiving fewer tokens in return, leading to losses for the vault shareholders.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `params.minPrimary` and `params.minSecondary` are calculated automatically based on the share of the Curve pool with a small discount within the `Curve2TokenConvexHelper._executeSettlement` function (Refer to Line 124 below)

When LP tokens are redeemed proportionally via the Curve Pool's [`remove_liquidity`](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/b0bbf77f8f93c9c5f4e415bce9cd71f0cdee960e/contracts/pools/steth/StableSwapSTETH.vy#L477) function, the tokens received are based on the share of the Curve pool as the source code.

```python
@external
@nonreentrant('lock')
def remove_liquidity(
    _amount: uint256,
    _min_amounts: uint256[N_COINS],
) -> uint256[N_COINS]:
    """
    @notice Withdraw coins from the pool
    @dev Withdrawal amounts are based on current deposit ratios
    @param _amount Quantity of LP tokens to burn in the withdrawal
    @param _min_amounts Minimum amounts of underlying coins to receive
    @return List of amounts of coins that were withdrawn
    """
    amounts: uint256[N_COINS] = self._balances()
    lp_token: address = self.lp_token
    total_supply: uint256 = ERC20(lp_token).totalSupply()
    CurveToken(lp_token).burnFrom(msg.sender, _amount)  # dev: insufficient funds

    for i in range(N_COINS):
        value: uint256 = amounts[i] * _amount / total_supply
        assert value >= _min_amounts[i], "Withdrawal resulted in fewer coins than expected"

        amounts[i] = value
        if i == 0:
            raw_call(msg.sender, b"", value=value)
        else:
            assert ERC20(self.coins[1]).transfer(msg.sender, value)

    log RemoveLiquidity(msg.sender, amounts, empty(uint256[N_COINS]), total_supply - _amount)

    return amounts
```

Assume a Curve Pool with the following state:

- Consists of 200 US Dollars worth of tokens (100 DAI and 100 USDC). DAI is the primary token
- DAI <> USDC price is 1:1
- Total Supply = 100 LP Pool Tokens

Assume that 50 LP Pool Tokens will be claimed during vault settlement. 

`TwoTokenPoolUtils._getMinExitAmounts` function will return `49.875 DAI` as `params.minPrimary` and `49.875 USDC` as `params.minSecondary` based on the following calculation

```solidity
minPrimary = (poolContext.primaryBalance * poolClaim * strategyContext.vaultSettings.poolSlippageLimitPercent /  (totalPoolSupply * uint256(VaultConstants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS)
minPrimary = (100 DAI * 50 LP_TOKEN * 99.75% /  (100 LP_TOKEN * 100%)

Rewrite for clarity (ignoring rounding error):
minPrimary = 100 DAI * (50 LP_TOKEN/100 LP_TOKEN) * (99.75%/100%) = 49.875 DAI

minSecondary = same calculation = 49.875 USDC
```

Curve Pool's [`remove_liquidity`](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/b0bbf77f8f93c9c5f4e415bce9cd71f0cdee960e/contracts/pools/steth/StableSwapSTETH.vy#L477) function will return `50 DAI` and `50 USDC` if 50 LP Pool Tokens are redeemed.

Note that `TwoTokenPoolUtils._getMinExitAmounts` function performs the calculation based on the spot balance of the pool similar to the approach of the Curve Pool's [`remove_liquidity`](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/b0bbf77f8f93c9c5f4e415bce9cd71f0cdee960e/contracts/pools/steth/StableSwapSTETH.vy#L477) function. However, the `TwoTokenPoolUtils._getMinExitAmounts` function applied a discount to the returned result, while the Curve Pool's [`remove_liquidity`](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/b0bbf77f8f93c9c5f4e415bce9cd71f0cdee960e/contracts/pools/steth/StableSwapSTETH.vy#L477) function did not. 

As such, the number of tokens returned by Curve Pool's [`remove_liquidity`](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/b0bbf77f8f93c9c5f4e415bce9cd71f0cdee960e/contracts/pools/steth/StableSwapSTETH.vy#L477) function will always be larger than the number of tokens returned by the `TwoTokenPoolUtils._getMinExitAmounts` function regardless of the on-chain economic condition or the pool state (e.g. imbalance). Thus, the minimum amounts (`minAmounts`) pass into the Curve Pool's `remove_liquidity` function will never be triggered under any circumstance.

```solidity
a = Curve Pool's remove_liquidity => x DAI
b = TwoTokenPoolUtils._getMinExitAmounts => (x DAI - 0.25% discount)
a > b => true (for all instances)
```

Thus, the `TwoTokenPoolUtils._getMinExitAmounts` function is not effective in determining the slippage when redeeming proportionally.

## Impact

A trade will always be executed even if it returns fewer than expected assets since the minimum amount returned by the `TwoTokenPoolUtils._getMinExitAmounts` function does not work effectively. Thus, a trade might incur unexpected slippage, resulting in the vault receiving fewer tokens in return, leading to losses for the vault shareholders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When redeeming proportional, the`TwoTokenPoolUtils._getMinExitAmounts` function can be removed. Instead, give the caller the flexibility to define the slippage/minimum amount (`params.minPrimary` and `params.minSecondary`). To prevent the caller from setting a slippage that is too large, consider restricting the slippage to an acceptable range.

The proper way of computing the minimum amount of tokens to receive from a proportional trade (`remove_liquidity`) is to call the Curve's Pool [`calc_token_amount`](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract/blob/b0bbf77f8f93c9c5f4e415bce9cd71f0cdee960e/contracts/pools/steth/StableSwapSTETH.vy#L266) function off-chain and reduce the values returned by the allowed slippage amount.

Note that `calc_token_amount` cannot be used solely on-chain for computing the minimum amount because the result can be manipulated because it uses spot balances for computation.

Sidenote: Removing `TwoTokenPoolUtils._getMinExitAmounts` function also removes the built-in spot price and oracle price validation. Thus, the caller must remember to define the slippage. Otherwise, the vault settlement will risk being sandwiched. Alternatively, shift the `strategyContext._checkPriceLimit(oraclePrice, spotPrice)` code outside the `TwoTokenPoolUtils._getMinExitAmounts` function.
