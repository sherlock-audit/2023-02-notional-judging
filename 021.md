# Liquidations are impossible for some Curve pools

## Summary

Some curve pools have implementations such that Notional liquidations always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

Liquidations are done, directly or indirectly, via the `deleverageAccount` function. This function calls `_checkReentrancyContext` to protect against read-only reentrancy.

The Curve vault's `_checkReentrancyContext` function uses the Curve `remove_liquidity` function to check the reentrancy context. However, for certain Curve pools like the CRV/ETH pool (0x8301ae4fc9c624d1d396cbdaa1ed877821d7c511, https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/crveth/) calling `remove_liquidity(0, [0,0])` always reverts due to an underflow.

## Impact

Liquidations are not possible, users can go into bad debt and there is no way to recover the lost funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `claim_admin_fees` function to check Curve's reentrancy state instead of `remove_liquidity`.
