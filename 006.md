# Oracle price used by the Protocol can be Stale / Outdated

## Summary

Lack of Validation on Oracle Price as recommended by chainlink in their docs can lead to price being stale or outdated.

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink oracle uses 2 triggers to update the Price:

1. If `Deviation Threshold` exceeds which means the Price has changed Drastically.
2. If `Heartbeat Threshold` exceeds. Heartbeat Threshold is a specific amount of time from the last update after which a new aggregation round will start and the price will be updated.

According to Chainlink documentation:

> If your application detects that the reported answer is not updated within the heartbeat or within time limits that you determine are acceptable for your application, pause operation or switch to an alternate operation mode while identifying the cause of the delay.

In couple of contracts given below in code snippet, only check done is to ensure that the value is not negative. But There is no check to find out whether the value provided by Chainlink is within the `Heartbeat Threshold` or not. If Not, the value will be a stale value which will be used by the Protocol for further logics.

## Impact

There is lack of Validation of Oracle Price resulting in the Price can be Stale / Outdated which is eventually Used by the protocol.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: WstETHChainlinkOracle.sol

    function _calculateAnswer() internal view returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    ) {
        int256 baseAnswer;
        (
            roundId,
            baseAnswer,
            startedAt,
            updatedAt,
            answeredInRound
        ) = baseOracle.latestRoundData();
        require(baseAnswer > 0, "Chainlink Rate Error");

        answer = baseAnswer * wstETH.stEthPerToken().toInt() / baseDecimals;
    }

```solidity
File: ChainlinkAdapter.sol

    function _calculateBaseToQuote() internal view returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    ) {
        int256 baseToUSD;
        (
            roundId,
            baseToUSD,
            startedAt,
            updatedAt,
            answeredInRound
        ) = baseToUSDOracle.latestRoundData();
        require(baseToUSD > 0, "Chainlink Rate Error");
        (
            /* roundId */,
            int256 quoteToUSD,
            /* uint256 startedAt */,
            /* updatedAt */,
            /* answeredInRound */
        ) = quoteToUSDOracle.latestRoundData();
        require(quoteToUSD > 0, "Chainlink Rate Error");

        // To convert from USDC/USD (base) and ETH/USD (quote) to USDC/ETH we do:
        // (USDC/USD * quoteDecimals * 1e18) / (ETH/USD * baseDecimals)
        answer = baseToUSD * quoteToUSDDecimals * rateDecimals / quoteToUSD / baseToUSDDecimals;
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add couple of more require checks given below to validate that the Data is correct:

```solidity

  require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "ChainLink: Stale price");
  require(block.timestamp - updatedAt > HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD, "ChainLink: Stale price");

```
